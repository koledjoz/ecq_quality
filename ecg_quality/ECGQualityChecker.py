    **ECG_Quality_Checker**
    ===================

    This class takes care of the processing and checking of the quality of ECG signal. Currently, it uses three main classes of signal in different modes:
    * Class 1: This corresponds to signal that is clean, with all waves being present.
    * Class 2 : This signal has some level of noise and the P and T waves are not detectable, but the QRS complex is still detectable.
    * Class 3: The noise is too large and no ECG segment can be found.

    The model works by using a sliding window, where each window is graded by a neural network with a score between 0 and 1. Over the signal, this score is averaged where the scores overlap and thresholds are applied. There are saved thresholds to be automatically used to prioritize better signal quality classification precision. The class works with signal in mV.

    To use this checker, first create an during which creation everything is specified. Then the class can repeatedly process EKG signal with the ecg_process method.

        Parameters
        --------------

        **model : str**
            This is the model to be used by the class. There are currently 4 possible models to use:
        * cnn2s : This model uses CNN architecture with the size of the sliding window being 2 seconds.
        * cnn5s : This model also uses CNN architecture but with the size of sliding window being 5 seconds.
        * lstm2s : This model uses LSTM based architecture with the sliding window size of 2 seconds.
        * oscnn2s : This model uses Omni-Scale block architecture, that is CNN based, with sliding window of size 2 seconds.


        **stride: float**
        This is the size of the step to be used represented as the ratio of the length of the window length. The class makes sure the length is at least 1 second and that the stride is a divisor of window length.


        **return_mode : str**
        There are totally 4 different modes that can be used when using this class to specify type of 		returned values:

        * score : The model will return continuous values of score in the range 0 to 1
        * three_value : The model will use two thresholds and return all three classes of signal, with values 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0.
        * binary_clean : The model will return either 1.0 for signal of Class 1 or 2.0 for signals of Class 2 and 3.
        * binary_qrs : The model will return 1.0 for signals of Class 1 and 2 and 2.0 for signal of class 3.0.



        **thresholds : list**
        The thresholds to be used by the model. Their amount needs to correspond to the type of classification we want to do. If we want to do three class classification, there need to be two thresholds, for both binary classifications, there needs to be just one.

        **return_type : str**

        This is how long will be the returned values. For mode full, the values of the length of the input signal will be used. The other mode, intervals, means that there will be a value returned for each short interval where the score does not change. These intervals are always the length of the stride in real values. For each of these intervals, there will be just one value returned.

        **sampling_rate : int**

        The models currently only support 250 Hz. Using any other frequency will result in fail. Slightly different frequencies can theoretically be used, but that is to be done at your own risk.

        **clean_data : bool**

        Whether the data should be cleaned before processing. The models were trained on cleaned data so this is advised unless you already cleaned data beforehand. For cleaning, we are using neurokit2 function ecg_clean with its default settings as of version 0.2.4.

        **check_window_range : bool**

        Whether each window should be checked for range. If the range of signal values is not larger than the value of the window_min_range, the widow will automatically be marked as a signal of quality 3. This is temporary solution to be used because of the models inability to detect low amplitude noise

        **window_min_range : float**

        This is the range that is to be used if the check_window_range parameter is true. If tha difference of the minimum and maximum value in window is smaller than this difference, automatically markt he signal as of the worst quality type.

check_window_range:bool=False, window_min_range:float=0.05
